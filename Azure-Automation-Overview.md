# Azure Automation Overview

> **What is Azure Automation?**  

Azure Automation is a **cloud-based process automation and configuration service** that helps you reduce manual tasks and simplify cloud and on-premises management.  

Core capabilities include:  

- **Runbooks** (PowerShell / Python) for task automation  
- **Desired State Configuration (DSC)** for system consistency  
- **Update Management Center (UMC)** for VM patching (supersedes classic Update Mgmt.)  
- **Change Tracking & Inventory** (files, registry, software, services)  
- **Hybrid Runbook Workers** to run jobs on-prem or in other clouds  
- **Integration with Azure Monitor & Graph API** for event-driven automation  

---

## Pre-requisites

- An **Azure Subscription**  
- **Permissions**:
  - *Owner* or *Contributor* (initial setup)  
  - Use **Automation Contributor** or **Automation Operator** for scoped access  
- **System-Managed Identity** for Graph API / Azure resource access  
- **Log Analytics workspace** (if you want monitoring, reporting, change tracking, or update mgmt.)

## Pricing

| Resource            | Pricing Example                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Job Runtime**     | First 500 mins free/month, then ~\$0.002/min  |
| **DSC Nodes**       | ~\$6/node/month                               |
| **Update Mgmt.**    | Now included via Update Mgmt. Center (free, but LA costs apply) |
| **Log Analytics**   | ~\$2.76/GB (UK South pricing)                 |
| **Hybrid Workers**  | Your VM costs (on-prem or cloud-hosted)       |

> ðŸ”¹ Tip: Always factor **Log Analytics ingestion** into cost estimatesâ€”itâ€™s often the biggest contributor.

## Setting up Azure Automation

1. **Create an Automation Account** in the desired region  
2. **Enable System-Managed Identity** and assign RBAC/Graph API permissions  
   - [Grant Graph API permissions via PowerShell](https://github.com/MG-Cloudflow/MSGraph-Examples/blob/main/Managed-Identity/GrandGraphApiPermissionV2.ps1)  
3. **Link to Log Analytics** for job logs, monitoring, and reporting  
4. **Import Modules** (Az, Graph, Intune, Microsoft365DSC, etc.)  
5. **Author Runbooks** (PowerShell, Python, Graphical, or Hybrid Worker)  
   - Import from GitHub, Storage, or write directly in the editor  
6. **Test and Publish Runbooks**, then schedule or trigger via webhook

## Types of Runbooks

| Runbook Type     | Language     | Notes                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PowerShell**   | PS 5.1 / 7.2 | Most widely used; Az + Graph modules supported                |
| **Python**       | 2.7 / 3.8    | Ideal for DevOps/data/ML tasks (3.10 coming soon)             |
| **Graphical**    | Drag/Drop    | No-code editor for visual workflows                           |
| **Hybrid**       | PS/Python    | Runs on-prem or other cloud VMs via Hybrid Worker             |
| **Webhook**      | HTTP/JSON    | Trigger from apps, Power Automate, or external systems        |
| **Scheduled**    | N/A          | Time-based automation (cron-like)                            |
| **Event-driven** | N/A          | Triggered by Azure Monitor alerts, Resource Events, or Graph  |

## Real-world Scenarios

| Scenario                        | Description                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intune Device Compliance**    | Use Graph API to audit & alert on compliance states        |
| **Entra Group Governance**      | Auto-check group sizes, email/report if over threshold     |
| **VM Patching**                 | Automate update schedules across mixed Azure/on-prem VMs   |
| **Backup / Archival**           | Export logs/reports to Azure Blob or SharePoint            |
| **Intune Policy Deployment**    | Push JSON templates with detection/remediation scripts     |
| **Lifecycle Cleanup**           | Remove stale users/devices in Entra ID or Intune           |
| **Security Automation**         | Isolate non-compliant devices, enforce policy via Graph    |

## Hybrid Worker Group Setup (On-Prem / Cloud)

1. Prepare a **Windows Server 2016+ or Linux VM**  
2. Install the **Hybrid Worker Agent** via script or portal  
3. Register with Automation Account  
4. Validate **heartbeat** and job status in the Azure Portal  
5. Use **Hybrid Worker Groups** for load balancing and HA  

---

## Monitoring, Alerts & Reporting

With **Log Analytics + Azure Monitor**, you can:  

- Track job runtimes and outcomes  
- Detect failures and trigger alerts  
- Build custom dashboards in **Power BI** or **Azure Workbooks**  
- Export reports to Storage, Email, or Teams  

**Sample KQL Query:**  

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "AUTOMATIONACCOUNTS"
| where OperationName == "Job"
| summarize count() by JobStatus_s, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
```

## Best Practices

- **Use Managed Identities**: Avoid service principals where possible, reduces secret management.  
- **Modularize Runbooks**: Create reusable runbooks for common tasks (logging, Graph auth, etc.).  
- **Version Control**: Store runbooks in GitHub/Azure Repos and automate import with pipelines.  
- **Monitor Costs**: Track Log Analytics ingestion; optimize queries and retention.  
- **Hybrid Worker HA**: Deploy multiple workers per group for redundancy.  
- **Use Tags & Naming Standards**: Easier to manage at scale and report on usage.  
- **Limit Permissions**: Apply least-privilege RBAC at Automation Account and resource scopes.  
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Always include try/catch and structured logging for jobs.  
- **Test in Sandbox First**: Validate changes in a non-prod Automation Account before rollout.  
- **Update Modules Regularly**: Keep Az/Graph/Intune modules updated to avoid compatibility issues.
