4. Validate heartbeat and readiness in Azure portal

>Monitoring, Alerts & Reporting

Log Analytics integration enables:

- Failure detection
- Scheduled reports
- Custom dashboards (Power BI / Workbooks)

Sample KQL Query:

`AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "AUTOMATIONACCOUNTS"
| where OperationName == "Job"
| summarize count() by JobStatus_s, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)`
